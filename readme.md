# Simulating Ball Movement



In JavaScript, you have the ability to identify an element based on its id, and change any attributes that are associated with the selected element (for example, styles). This is made possible thanks to your browser's interpretation of the HTML code you have written. When your HTML page is loaded in a browser, the browser creates a tree structure representation of all the HTML elements you described in your page. This structure makes it easy for web programming languages like JavaScript to find elements on the page using their respective id and other attributes.



After implementing these changes, the ball should bounce diagonally between the defined points on both the x-axis and y-axis.



- Add an HTML and a JavaScript code that will allow the ball to move between two fixed positions on the x-axis and y-axis on the page.
